    <H2>Second Verse</H2>
    <p>Now five years later on, you've got the world at your feet</p>
    <p>Success has been so easy for you</p>
    <p>But don't forget, it's me who put you where you are now</p>
    <p>And I can put you back down too</p>

    <H2>Third Verse</H2>
    <p>Don't, don't you want me?</p>
      <p>You know I can't believe it when I hear that you won't see me</p>
    <p>Don't, don't you want me?</p>
      <p>You know I don't believe you when you say that you don't need me</p>
     <p> It's much too late to find</p>
      <p>You think you've changed your mind</p>
     <p> You'd better change it back, or we will both be sorry</p>
